# Relative Bible: Characters and Relationships

Relative Bible is an iOS mobile bible application written in [Swift](https://developer.apple.com/swift/).

## So who are the parents and children of Moses?

There are many bible apps out there but they can't answer you this question. 
Relative Bible is here to give you the opportunity to learn about,
* the relationships between characters, 
* their backgrounds,
* their stories,
* their concordances (verses they appear in throughout the bible). 

## Visualize the Data

* With more than 1000+ characters explained in detail, think of it as a giant family tree but bundled in an app. 
* Relative Bible provides an easier way to explore this family tree with a colorful graph data structure visualization, laying out the relationships on your screen.
* Data is made available thanks to [Viz.Bible](https://m.viz.bible/).
